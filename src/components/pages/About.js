    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am IT Professional and a budding Full Stack Web Developer, familiar with current web technologies. I can find my way around the DOM. When not creating websites that bring joy, I'm usually hanging with my family. I enjoy learning new things about many topics but especially those concerning finance, history, sci-fi/fantasy and web technologies.
