    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am full time Healthcare IT Professional and a part time/pro-bono budding Full Stack Web Developer, familiar with current web technologies. I can find my way around the DOM. When not working hard or creating websites that bring joy, you can usually find me enjoying time with my family. I enjoy learning new things about many topics but especially those concerning finance, history, sci-fi/fantasy and web technologies.
